These involved immersive multi-screen++projections that surrounded the audience.++++++The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide projectors++instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that would play++short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The animations++were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides were loaded++into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping fashion. It++was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the++projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would use++up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a++component.++++++The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories are recalled in a++fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous++stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling.++Moments filled with fluttering details.++++++I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic,++generic, and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed++to trigger memories in the viewer.	/projects/TheTESTProject	TheTESTProject			'The TEST; Project'	Component
