  description: >-
    I produced an interactive Software Development portal that was built in
    Flash. It allowed for searching, browsing, and consumption of the content
    related to developing on the Cingular(AT&T) Mobile Platform. I worked
    closely with their team to build an application that would import and
    display dynamic content. The client was able to produce content and deliver
    it to the app in the form of XML for presentation.
