    "description": "> Wanted Santa was a creation for ESET, a European online security company.  Wanted Santa allowed you to get arrested, have your mugshot taken, write a message, and then share it freely with your friends. It was a fun Flash-based microsite that incorporated features such as the ability to upload your photo to customize the message written on the picture and then forward it as a single JPEG image to multiple friends.  Because ESET was a reasonably large company, we built the system to handle a massive load of users using load-balancing technology."
