  titleMain: 'MPPS: The Mobile Phone Photo Show'
  subtitle: >-
    The first gallery exhibit of its kind showing the work of over 400
    participants from around the world. Coinciding with the release of camera
    phones, MPPS allowed participants to send images into the gallery in
    real-time during a defined time period. The result was a meta-snapshot of
    the world from the hands of people in each region.
  description: >-
    The Mobile Phone Photo Show was the first cell phone photography show. The
    emergence of the mobile phone camera also opened up a new means of
    self-expression.  The conceptual gallery exhibit acted as an inversion of
    the traditional gallery show. Artists We're spread out all over the world,
    with more than 400 contributors and their mobile phones submitting work into
    the gallery where it would be printed out and stuck on the walls. This
    outward in approach created a meta-snapshot of the world at that point in
    time. The event took place in San Francisco, but the images were submitted
    from as far away as Siberia, South Africa, India, Argentina, Australia, and
    Japan.
