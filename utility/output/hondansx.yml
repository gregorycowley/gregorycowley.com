    Honda launched the released its new supercar. I used HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript to develop the presentation layer that was added to the existing
    Honda website backend.  Honda's latest supercar incarnation, the venerable
    Honda NSX, was being released. The website to mark the occasion was designed
    by Razorfish in Los Angeles. I joined the team to do the front-end
    development and the visual presentation layer for this subsection of the
    Honda USA website.
