  description: >-
    In 2005, while continuing to work on Content Management Systems, I branched
    out to explore my lifelong interest in photography.  I built a commercial
    photography studio located in the Dogpatch area of San Francisco. There I
    worked with clients including IDEO, Adobe, University Games, and Intel. I
    also had hundreds of individuals come through the studio doors for
    portraiture and custom commissions.  Although the studio itself is now
    closed, I cultivated relationships with editorial clients whom I continue to
    work with and am able to take on new clients. The physical activity and
    artistry involved with my photography business provides a nice balance to my
    work in web development.
