    I constructed a fully operational 4 by 8 foot CNC machine based on the Open
    Source Maslow CNC system.
  description: >-
    I've had a longtime interest in the fabrication of furniture and large scale
    products, but lacked the resources to produce such products. Instead, I
    often would build things by hand, limited by the tools I had. Many of the
    best designs I created were out of the range of my abilities  I wanted to
    work with computer-controlled rapid prototyping, and finally, I had the
    opportunity to build a CNC machine on my own using open source content from
    Maslow CNC. I created the initial CNC machine to work with four by eight
    sheets of plywood. Over time I've made continuous improvements to improve
    accuracy and speed. I've learned computer-controlled fabrication technology
    from the inside out.
