    "description": "> In 2005, while continuing to work on Content Management Systems, I branched out to explore my lifelong interest in photography.  I built a commercial photography studio located in the Dogpatch area of San Francisco. There I worked with clients including IDEO, Adobe, University Games, and Intel. I also had hundreds of individuals come through the studio doors for portraiture and custom commissions.  Although the studio itself is now closed, I cultivated relationships with editorial clients whom I continue to work with and am able to take on new clients. The physical activity and artistry involved with my photography business provides a nice balance to my work in web development."
