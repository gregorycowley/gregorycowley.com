  description: >-
    Dr Pepper was a major sponsor of the Academy of Country Music Awards. They
    wanted a marketing piece in the form of a CDROM to be distributed throughout
    Walmart stores. We created content that included games, videos, and musical
    toys related to the Academy of Country Music Awards. The finished disks were
    placed in displays and included free with the purchase of Dr Pepper
    products.
