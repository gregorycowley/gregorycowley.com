  titleMain: IDEO New Years Digital Cards
  subtitle: >-
    A digital holiday card that encouraged IDEO employees to share their best
    experiences of the year. Each card transformed each contributed memory into
    a collection of dynamic and interactive visual animations.
  description: >-
    IDEO began introducing an annual digital New Year's card that allowed its
    employees around the world to contribute memories of the year through an
    interactive format. For the inaugural design, each employee could make their
    own personal snowflake, which included a favorite memory and information
    about the employee. The snowflakes floated in a 3D interactive environment
    allowing team members to learn about each creator and their memory for that
    year.
