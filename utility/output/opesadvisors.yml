  description: >-
    Opes Advisors, a financial investment advising firm, needed an intranet for
    their employees to be able to manage their clients and internal documents.
    In addition, they required a public-facing site for marketing and blogging
    purposes. For this project, both the internet and extranet versions were
    built on Joomla.
