  description: >-
    As an engineer for Blurb, I was solely responsible for Bookify, a legacy
    product application built using Adobe Flex technology. The original
    application had not been updated in years. Finding more efficient ways to
    improve the user experience was part of the job. I pruned unused code and
    improved performance by 300%. My job also included adding new features and
    maintaining the API connections with Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, and other
    photo-sharing websites. Users could also upload photos directly to the
    application in their web browser. I built a system for tracking errors,
    measuring performance, and managing customer support issues.
