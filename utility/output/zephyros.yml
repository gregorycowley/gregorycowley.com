    Directed and produced a fully non-linear interactive presentation for a
    prototype product created through a partnership between IDEO and Intel.
  description: >-
    Fully produced in-house by Gregory Cowley Studios, the Zephyros presentation
    was a project initiated by the Intel mobile platforms group. It involved
    prototype products produced in collaboration with IDEO.  The prototypes were
    portable electronics foreshadowing the coming of the iPhone and the iPad.
    Items that we now take for granted as universal mobile technology. The
    Zephyros project included an interactive presentation that showed the use of
    hypothetical products in context. Vignettes of different countries around
    the world were simulated. The presentation took the audience from Beijing to
    Seoul, to San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Munich, and New Delhi.  The presentation
    starred a range of users from business professionals to students,
    backpackers, travelers, and ordinary people. Zephyros was meant to show how
    these products can be integrated into everyday life and to show how the
    products could enhance work and life experiences.
