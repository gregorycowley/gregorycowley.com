    case scenarios.
  description: >-
    Motorola had several internal projects that ranged from prototypes for the
    interaction of screens on their line of mobile phones to an internal
    competition to develop innovative ideas for features to be added to future
    products.  I designed and animated the finalists' proposals, which were
    presented for voting during the competition. These included illustrations,
    diagrams, and animations of how each entry worked.
