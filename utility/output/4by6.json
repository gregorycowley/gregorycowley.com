    "description": "> While working for 4by6.com, I architected an automated production system driven by a printing portal website. This system allowed users to upload their graphics files to be pre-flighted and validated for printing. Problem files were sorted out, and the clients were notified.  Files that were ready for printing were organized into a grid system. The resulting grid could be printed on a single sheet of paper, lowering costs and make the more efficient use of resources. The system was fully automated, using web technologies as well as dedicated machines on-site and custom software."
