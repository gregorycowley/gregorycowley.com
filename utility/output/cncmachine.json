    "description": "> I've had a longtime interest in the fabrication of furniture and large scale products, but lacked the resources to produce such products. Instead, I often would build things by hand, limited by the tools I had. Many of the best designs I created were out of the range of my abilities  I wanted to work with computer-controlled rapid prototyping, and finally, I had the opportunity to build a CNC machine on my own using open source content from Maslow CNC. I created the initial CNC machine to work with four by eight sheets of plywood. Over time I've made continuous improvements to improve accuracy and speed. I've learned computer-controlled fabrication technology from the inside out."
