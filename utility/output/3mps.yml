  description: >-
    As a designer and technical producer of the Three-Minute Picture Show, an
    annual festival of short films, I executed the branding, website, marketing
    materials, and collateral. I also managed technical coordination of the film
    screenings, including the conversion of the various formats that were
    submitted into a consistent playable format for the theater. All the events
    took place in art house theaters in San Francisco and Portland.
