  description: >-
    While working for 4by6.com, I architected an automated production system
    driven by a printing portal website. This system allowed users to upload
    their graphics files to be pre-flighted and validated for printing. Problem
    files were sorted out, and the clients were notified.  Files that were ready
    for printing were organized into a grid system. The resulting grid could be
    printed on a single sheet of paper, lowering costs and make the more
    efficient use of resources. The system was fully automated, using web
    technologies as well as dedicated machines on-site and custom software.
