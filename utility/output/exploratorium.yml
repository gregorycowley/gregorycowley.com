  titleMain: Exploratorium Exhibit Creation
  subtitle: >-
    Fabrication, and some design, for an outdoor installation project installed
    in Civic Center, San Francisco. The exhibit encouraged social interaction
    using tangible interfaces controlled by hidden computer technology.
  description: >-
    Middleground, an Exploratorium external site project, was a series of towers
    that encouraged people to interact with activities and each other.
    Middleground itself is a rehabilitation and recovery program. The
    installation acted as a happy place to further encourage this recovery and
    introduce people to the work Middleground does. The structure was installed
    in Civic Center, near City Hall in front of the San Francisco Public
    Library.
