  description: >-
    I developed a series of iPhone apps meant for the live social environment.
    The apps fostered fun for social events in bars, restaurants, at parties,
    and at work.  The applications included an animated wheel of fortune to
    choose what drink you were going to order, a compliment generator that on
    upon shaking the phone would give you a nice compliment, and a message
    correspondence app that allows for sending handwritten notes to friends.
