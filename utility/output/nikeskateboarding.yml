    A prestige project for Nike skateboarding shoes, this project was the
    creation of a dynamic shoe browser that used animation to entertain and wow.
  description: >-
    Odopod created the Nike skateboarding website, which showcases skateboarding
    shoes and the Nike sponsored skaters that endorse them.  I created an
    interactive shoe browsing interface that included an animated filtering
    system. Users could manipulate the settings to cause shoes to fall off the
    shelves and new shoes to fly back up to replace them.
