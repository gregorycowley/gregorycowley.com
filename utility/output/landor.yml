  description: >-
    For over ten years, I worked with teams at Landor Associates to brand and
    create corporate identities for companies including the Olympics, American
    Airlines, Clorox, HP, Rice a Roni, Ford Motor Company, and John Deere. As
    the leading brand identity and corporate identity company, it was a
    privilege to be a team player in both their San Francisco and Hong Kong
    offices.
