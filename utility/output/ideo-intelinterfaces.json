    "description": "> Intel's Mobile Platform Group (MPG) has a mission to propose mobile devices that use Intel technology. They worked closely with IDEO to build prototypes that implemented Intel technologies and could be licensed by equipment manufacturers. Cinema quality videos with dramatic storylines were created to weave narratives around how the technologies would be used in the real world.  A professional film production company was hired to produce these vignettes, which showed the hypothetical products being used in real-life situations. Within the videos, the actors would use props and green screens. My job was to animate graphics and overlay them in-post using After Effects. These non-functional prototypes were brought to life and responded to the interactions of the actors."
