  subtitle: >-
    An interactive microsite for playing Santa, getting arrested, and letting
    all your friends know.
  description: >-
    Wanted Santa was a creation for ESET, a European online security company. 
    Wanted Santa allowed you to get arrested, have your mugshot taken, write a
    message, and then share it freely with your friends. It was a fun
    Flash-based microsite that incorporated features such as the ability to
    upload your photo to customize the message written on the picture and then
    forward it as a single JPEG image to multiple friends.  Because ESET was a
    reasonably large company, we built the system to handle a massive load of
    users using load-balancing technology.
