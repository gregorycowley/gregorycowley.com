    I created the motion graphics for a series of short films showcasing
    hypothetical digital devices seamlessly interfacing into everyday life.
  description: >-
    Intel's Mobile Platform Group (MPG) has a mission to propose mobile devices
    that use Intel technology. They worked closely with IDEO to build prototypes
    that implemented Intel technologies and could be licensed by equipment
    manufacturers. Cinema quality videos with dramatic storylines were created
    to weave narratives around how the technologies would be used in the real
    world.  A professional film production company was hired to produce these
    vignettes, which showed the hypothetical products being used in real-life
    situations. Within the videos, the actors would use props and green screens.
    My job was to animate graphics and overlay them in-post using After Effects.
    These non-functional prototypes were brought to life and responded to the
    interactions of the actors.
