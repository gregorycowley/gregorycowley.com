    RX Gallery Art and Technology Space in the SF Tenderloin.  RX Gallery was an
    art bar with a focus on art and technology-centered in the Tenderloin area
    of San Francisco. At the time, it was the pinnacle of art and technology in
    the region. We worked closely with artists and arts institutions that shared
    our interest in digital and electronic expression. The gallery operated from
    2003 to 2008.
