    "description": "> Transcinema existed to create an audience and appreciation for a global group of new media artists. The emerging new digital media were an acquired taste, and many traditional art spaces weren't recognizing the importance of this new genre. Transcinema was a means to educate the public about digital experiences, and the contemplations these experiences can evoke.  The emergence of new media was inspiring creative works. Transcinema intended to bring together a worldwide collection of artists who were working in similar media.  In order to foster universal recognition of this work, Transcinema sought to bring those artists together and create an audience with understanding and appreciation for new media artworks."
