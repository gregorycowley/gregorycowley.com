thetestproject,"the-test-project","The TEST:Project","A conceptual and experiential new media arts project using projection for live performances and installations.","As a founder of the TEST:Project, I created live, computer-controlled sight, sound, and spatial experiences. These involved immersive multi-screen projections that surrounded the audience.

The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide projectors instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that would play short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The animations were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides were loaded into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping fashion. It was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would use up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a component.

The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories are recalled in a fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling. Moments filled with fluttering details.

I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic, generic, and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed to trigger memories in the viewer.

In order to foster universal recognition of this work, Transcinema sought to bring those artists together and create an audience with understanding and appreciation for new media artworks.

I worked with the team to create a developer portal to add to the company offering that would give further visual control to developers for the API. The motivation was also to allow upper management, which is not familiar with an API system's inner workings, to visualize and understand VoiceBase's product and to create visualization tools for a non-technical audience.

The Zephyros project included an interactive presentation that showed the use of hypothetical products in context. Vignettes of different countries around the world were simulated. The presentation took the audience from Beijing to Seoul, to San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Munich, and New Delhi.

The presentation starred a range of users from business professionals to students, backpackers, travelers, and ordinary people. Zephyros was meant to show how these products can be integrated into everyday life and to show how the products could enhance work and life experiences.
