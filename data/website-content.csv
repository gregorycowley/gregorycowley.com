He began his career in 1992 working in the Bay Area design, branding and advertising industry after graduating with a BFA in graphic design. In these early days Gregory explored photography as a fine art and shot liberally in the hours after his day job was complete. Photography was always his primary love, but he kept this creative outlet open to the arts and not to commerce.

In 1994 Gregory relocated to Hong Kong where he continued to work in the design industry. It was there that he began a series of journeys into the remote regions of China and South East Asia. He created a series of photo essays about the people and cultures in these regions. This was the beginning of Gregory's passion for portraiture. He remains an avid traveller and his photography adventures have taken him to five continents.

After returning to San Francisco, Gregory focused his photography work on the fine arts and gallery circuit. He was inspired by the work of Bill Viola and Gary Hill. In 1997 he launched an ambitious project to explore the performance possibilities of photography. The aptly named TEST project was started in 1997 and used up to 32 slide projectors over 8 screens to create immersive visual environments. Gregory’s work appeared as installations at The Here Art Center in New York, Portland State University, The Exploratorium, and SFMOMA.

In 2005 Gregory embraced photography as his full time passion. Since then he’s been producing high-end photography for top commercial photography clients. Gregory has honed his skills as a studio photographer and master of lighting. He has worked with celebrities and keeps his attention on the need for good story telling and connection with his subjects. He works diligently to unite the values of photojournalism, fine art photography, and graphic design. Gregory remains a craftsman and believes strongly in skill and attention to detail.

In addition to his work as a photographer Gregory has also spearheaded interactivity and technology projects in the arts world through the creation of the Transcinema Festival and the Rx Gallery. Currently he is an adjunct professor at the California College of the Arts. He has taught courses at the Academy of Art University and regularly teaches workshops out of his studio in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco.

Bookify was my primary focus while working for Blurb. I was the lead engineer and soley responsible for the engineering of the project. However, at times I was allowed to bring on other team members that I oversaw.

We used the Agile Methodology. New features and bug fixes were added in two-week sprints. I worked with the QA, a project manager, and a product owner during daily scrum meetings to plan sprints and target quarterly objectives. 

Bookify was built in ActionScript 3.0, the much-maligned code behind Flash. In reality it was was Java that sort of resembled JavaScript. The backend was driven by Ruby. The workflow included Git, Jenkins, Groovy, Selenium, Jira, and Ant for building.

I later led the effort to rebuild the application using JavaScript and React, once it was clear that Flash was about to expire.

Since 2002 I've taught courses in multiple departments at the California College of the Arts in SF. My students have been graduate, undergraduate, extended learning, and high school students in the pre-college program. At this time I am an adjunct professor in the Interaction Design Department.

I am currently teaching interaction design using a very narrow topic, tangible user interfaces. Students are encouraged to use affordances, signifiers, constraints and feed to create experiences that go beyond the screen.

I teach students to conceptualize, iterate, prototype and present interaction ideas. We use techniques like ""smoke and mirrors"" to present concepts in action before extensive development to get buy-in from the client.

I'm preaching what I practice.

Reactable is the tool of choice this semester. It is an open source C++ codebase with a Processing interface. The software uses a camera to see barcode-like fiducials and respond to their position and rotation. I am guiding students through breaking down the problems, brainstorming solutions, and developing concepts that can be translated to Reactable platform. We use interaction design principles and UX techniques throughout the course. The students will be making their own tables, installing cameras and video projectors, and writing the code needed for the user interface using Processing.

For some reason I always seem to have classes where I'm teaching designers—who hate to code—how to code. It's a daunting but rewarding task.",CCA,/projects/CCA,projects/CCA/CCA-top-161_scxam8,[object Object],[object Object]
chronopolis,chronopolis,Chronopolis,"Developed in response to the 911 atrocities, Chronopolis was a large-scale interactive projection installation that was presented in Paris at the La Villette Numerique festival.

Chronolopis was a conceptual city represented by a graphic clock. This fictional place existed in between standard and metric time. Responding to the gathering of people on the floor, a computer measured the population to interpret the effect that the population has on the perception of time.

""Chronopolis focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. By intertwining notions of time, urbanism and electronic media, we are asking how representations of time can still makes sense in a globalized, accelerated and unstable present.""- Erik Adigard and Chris Salter
Chronopolis is a clock based on metric time (a French concept from the 1800's). The clock is driven by population.&nbsp;I worked with Erik and Chris as a pure collaboration with great minds. Built in San Francisco and installed in a massive new media even in Paris. I built a flash based animated grid that kept metric time. It interfaced with MAX/MSP with respond to data collected by a video camera attached to the ceiling.Installed at the La Villette numerique.
    Configuring the video projector and IR camera while on the ground.
    People wanted video game experiences. Instant gratification and responsive feedback. This wan't that kind of exhibit, which confused some people. Children in particular tried to kick, stomp on and run over the visual components to get a reaction.

____


Chronopolis was presented to the public as part of the Villette Numerique Digital Art Festival at the Parc de la Villette in Paris in 2002.

It was a very large scale, 10 meter square, floor projection that invited visitors to roam around its surface. The piece counted the number of people present and altered the projection based on the ""local population""

The concept, by Erik Adigard and Chris Salter, focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. Put simply the artwork asked whether population distorts the perception of time. 

I contributed by creating the graphics and animations that could be dynamically morphed using data from an infrared camera placed above. The camera was attached to a computer running Max/MSP with Jitter. A second computer running an ActionScript/Flash application controlled the graphics and connected to the projector. Yes, these were early days and a single computer didn't have the processing power.

thetestproject,thetestproject,The TEST:Project,"As a founder of the TEST:Project, I created live, computer-controlled sight, sound, and spatial experiences. These involved immersive multi-screen projections that surrounded the audience.

The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide projectors instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that would play short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The animations were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides were loaded into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping fashion. It was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would use up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a component.

The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories are recalled in a fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling. Moments filled with fluttering details.

I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic, generic, and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed to trigger memories in the viewer.

AV combination performance and installation artConceptualized and executed computer control of analog devices, primarily 32 slide projectors at a time aimed at multiple screens.Presented to the public in San Francisco, San Jose, New York and Portland
    Following the lead of Edward Muybridge and the persistence of vision that led to the creation of movies, this was a mechanical animation machine like the zoetrope but controlled with digital technology.



In the early 90's, I started my new media artist career using a platform of screens, projectors, photography, electronics, sound, and software that I affectionately called TEST:. I presented the work as both a performance and installation depending on the venue and the content.

The objective was to explore how the images affect memories. Like smell which can instantly trigger thoughts of childhood experience, an image, even one you didn't take, can trigger a memory of something similar. A place, a pet, a loved one, a time or an experience.  

Images become both a mirror for you to reflect your own experience and a shadow, literally, of an event in the past. Digital has taken magic out of the process, but the original transparent slide is literally a shadow, a capturing of light reflecting off a very real object. It's a signature, a thumbprint, of the people, places, and things represented in the image.

The initial control system used Macromedia Director and Lingo along with assembly language on PIC processors. Later ActionScript was used to create a UI that functioned like a drum squencer.

The overall hardware. software and content design of TEST: was iterated through trial and error. Each performance was a 'test', and the thus the name. Ideas were tried, tweaks were made, and the entire contraption was dismantled, rebuilt, and reinstalled in different venues.

Bulk was a problem and ultimately killed the project. I shipped over a ton to places as far as New York for installations. It wasn't practical.

I'd like to see TEST: reborn using custom made projection systems. The tech has evolved to where Kodak Ektagraphic projectors and even the standard 2x2 slide are irrelevant. Using video projectors would be a distraction—simply repackaging the idea for a different format. But custom designed devices making use of custom optics, LEDs, pneumatics, and encoders could really be something different.

I've forever been obsessed with technology and the arts. I was traditionally trained as a painter, photographer, and visual artist.
I'd always been attracted to the possibilities of electronics in the arts. During my childhood, access to such things as animation tools and motion pictures and video equipment was not an option because of the cost involved. Even super eight films were out of my price range. So I was very interested in what could be hacked together to create these experiences without having any kind of budget whatsoever. I worked early on with garage sale to find secondhand store discoveries, explore what I could do with, manipulate, and learn from. 

I'm the son of an electrical technician. I grew up with soldering irons and oscilloscopes. Technology came to be very easy, as did the arts and visual expression.

I was a movie buff. I loved and had a fascination with fantasy.

I've developed my sub-skills carefully through an ongoing 
obsession with learning that has existed my entire life. I am forever learning about new things, sometimes by choice and sometimes not.
