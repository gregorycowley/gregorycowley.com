  As a software engineer at VoiceBase, a startup that works with voice
  recognition and AI analytics for call centers, I was responsible for creating
  a visual transcription player. This audio player would play through an audio
  recording and highlight the words in a written AI-generated transcript. The
  player was the only front-end for what was almost entirely an API voice
  recognition and voice analytics service. 


  I worked with the team to create a developer portal to add to the company
  offering that would give further visual control to developers for the API. The
  motivation was also to allow upper management, which is not familiar with an
  API system's inner workings, to visualize and understand VoiceBase's product
  and to create visualization tools for a non-technical audience.
