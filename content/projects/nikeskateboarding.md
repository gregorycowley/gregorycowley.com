  Odopod created the Nike skateboarding website, which showcases skateboarding
  shoes and the Nike sponsored skaters that endorse them.


  I created an interactive shoe browsing interface that included an animated
  filtering system. Users could manipulate the settings to cause shoes to fall
  off the shelves and new shoes to fly back up to replace them.
