  Luminox makes military-grade watches marketed towards the military and outdoor
  enthusiasts. I worked closely with the company founders to create an online
  catalog of their products. The site included a custom content management
  system that I hand-coded using PHP. The admin section of the site allowed the
  marketing team to add new products and update information.
