### Support myself as an artist and create great work.  

Using andy warhol as a business model
- Artists don't make money
- Need a marketable skill
- Make money from skill to pay for art


After college I set out to get a job in San Francisco. It was tough going but I had an ace up my sleeve. I knew how to use computers at a time when almost no one did. Especially typical employees in design and advertising firms. It was easy to get started in my career as a freelancer. I built a base of clients and could maintain a steady income while also having time and money to engage with the arts.

I was a self starter and spent late nights mulling over manuals to learn design software tools. At first it was having specially access to a computer room in the art department of my college. Later I worked for a design services company that had all the tools and manuals. This company also gave me all the contacts I needed at the major design and advertising firms for me to launch my solo career.

I worked with Photoshop, Quark and Illustrator to create works for print. There was packaging for Dell Computers, labels for Coors cans and boxes, add campaigns for Got Milk, and the first minimal Flash animations for Nike and Apple.

It was a unique time. The world was transitioning into Desktop publishing. Personal computers were sprouting up everywhere. And this thing called the internet was just about to make a splash.

Prior to and even during the first years of the internet, interactive experiences were painfully rare and boring. There was fun to be had with amusement parks, the Exploratorium, video games, and some creative CDROMs. There was so much potential, but realizing it was almost out of reach. Computers were slow and expensive. Screens were small. And even the best experiences left me wanting more.
