  Fully produced in-house by Gregory Cowley Studios, the Zephyros presentation
  was a project initiated by the Intel mobile platforms group. It involved
  prototype products produced in collaboration with IDEO.


  The prototypes were portable electronics foreshadowing the coming of the
  iPhone and the iPad. Items that we now take for granted as universal mobile
  technology. The Zephyros project included an interactive presentation that
  showed the use of hypothetical products in context. Vignettes of different
  countries around the world were simulated. The presentation took the audience
  from Beijing to Seoul, to San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Munich, and New Delhi.


  The presentation starred a range of users from business professionals to
  students, backpackers, travelers, and ordinary people. Zephyros was meant to
  show how these products can be integrated into everyday life and to show how
  the products could enhance work and life experiences.
