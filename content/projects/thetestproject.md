  As a founder of the TEST:Project, I created live, computer-controlled sight,
  sound, and spatial experiences. These involved immersive multi-screen
  projections that surrounded the audience.


  The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide projectors
  instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that would play
  short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The animations
  were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides were loaded
  into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping fashion. It
  was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the
  projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would use
  up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a
  component.


  The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories are recalled in a
  fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous
  stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling.
  Moments filled with fluttering details.


  I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic,
  generic, and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed
  to trigger memories in the viewer.

An series of fractured cinema perfomances and installations
AV combination performance and installation artConceptualized and executed computer control of analog devices, primarily 32 slide projectors at a time aimed at multiple screens.Presented to the public in San Francisco, San Jose, New York and Portland
    Following the lead of Edward Muybridge and the persistence of vision that led to the creation of movies, this was a mechanical animation machine like the zoetrope but controlled with digital technology.



In the early 90's, I started my new media artist career using a platform of screens, projectors, photography, electronics, sound, and software that I affectionately called TEST:. I presented the work as both a performance and installation depending on the venue and the content.

The objective was to explore how the images affect memories. Like smell which can instantly trigger thoughts of childhood experience, an image, even one you didn't take, can trigger a memory of something similar. A place, a pet, a loved one, a time or an experience.  

Images become both a mirror for you to reflect your own experience and a shadow, literally, of an event in the past. Digital has taken magic out of the process, but the original transparent slide is literally a shadow, a capturing of light reflecting off a very real object. It's a signature, a thumbprint, of the people, places, and things represented in the image.

The initial control system used Macromedia Director and Lingo along with assembly language on PIC processors. Later ActionScript was used to create a UI that functioned like a drum squencer.

The overall hardware. software and content design of TEST: was iterated through trial and error. Each performance was a 'test', and the thus the name. Ideas were tried, tweaks were made, and the entire contraption was dismantled, rebuilt, and reinstalled in different venues.

Bulk was a problem and ultimately killed the project. I shipped over a ton to places as far as New York for installations. It wasn't practical.

I'd like to see TEST: reborn using custom made projection systems. The tech has evolved to where Kodak Ektagraphic projectors and even the standard 2x2 slide are irrelevant. Using video projectors would be a distractionâ€”simply repackaging the idea for a different format. But custom designed devices making use of custom optics, LEDs, pneumatics, and encoders could really be something different.
