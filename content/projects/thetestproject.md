  As a founder of the TEST:Project, I created live, computer-controlled sight,
  sound, and spatial experiences. These involved immersive multi-screen
  projections that surrounded the audience.


  The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide projectors
  instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that would play
  short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The animations
  were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides were loaded
  into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping fashion. It
  was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the
  projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would use
  up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a
  component.


  The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories are recalled in a
  fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous
  stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling.
  Moments filled with fluttering details.


  I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic,
  generic, and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed
  to trigger memories in the viewer.
