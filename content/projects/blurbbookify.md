description: >-
  As an engineer for Blurb, I was solely responsible for Bookify, a legacy
  product application built using Adobe Flex technology. The original
  application had not been updated in years. Finding more efficient ways to
  improve the user experience was part of the job. I pruned unused code and
  improved performance by 300%. My job also included adding new features and
  maintaining the API connections with Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, and other
  photo-sharing websites. Users could also upload photos directly to the
  application in their web browser. I built a system for tracking errors,
  measuring performance, and managing customer support issues.

This is one example of the type of work I've been doing since 2010. My title has been Senior Software Engineer and I've been working on applications built for the web and mobile devices.

Blurb Bookify was an enterprise level online book editor that allowed customers to choose templates, upload photos, arrange and design pages, add text, preview, and ultimately publish a color coffee table book.

Bookify was my primary focus while working for Blurb. I was the lead engineer and soley responsible for the engineering of the project. However, at times I was allowed to bring on other team members that I oversaw.

We used the Agile Methodology. New features and bug fixes were added in two-week sprints. I worked with the QA, a project manager, and a product owner during daily scrum meetings to plan sprints and target quarterly objectives. 

Bookify was built in ActionScript 3.0, the much-maligned code behind Flash. In reality it was was Java that sort of resembled JavaScript. The backend was driven by Ruby. The workflow included Git, Jenkins, Groovy, Selenium, Jira, and Ant for building.

I later led the effort to rebuild the application using JavaScript and React, once it was clear that Flash was about to expire.
