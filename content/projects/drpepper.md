  Dr. Pepper was a major supporter of the American Red Cross. They commissioned
  an educational series of CDROMs geared towards kids. The disks were loaded
  with creative content that taught kids about the focus of the Red Cross. These
  included a range of life-saving relief services running from basic first aid
  to recovering from natural disasters.
