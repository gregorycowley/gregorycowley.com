  Middleground, an Exploratorium external site project, was a series of towers
  that encouraged people to interact with activities and each other.
  Middleground itself is a rehabilitation and recovery program. The installation
  acted as a happy place to further encourage this recovery and introduce people
  to the work Middleground does. The structure was installed in Civic Center,
  near City Hall in front of the San Francisco Public Library.

This project need no introduction, of course. I've included it because it is recent and relevant. As a volunteer I worked with Doug, Adam and Dave to build out the digital portions of this project. By asking questions and offering solutions I contributed to the team and worked autonomously on the project. This is how I like to work. This is what makes me happy and this is why I want to be part of the Exploratorium.
