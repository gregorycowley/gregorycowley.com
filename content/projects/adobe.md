  Acting as producer and lead photographer, I created images for the packaging
  of Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements.


  I worked closely with the client to coordinate the initial casting sessions,
  prop procurement, and managed cast and crew to get the job done on schedule
  and within budget.
