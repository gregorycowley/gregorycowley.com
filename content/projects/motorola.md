  Motorola had several internal projects that ranged from prototypes for the
  interaction of screens on their line of mobile phones to an internal
  competition to develop innovative ideas for features to be added to future
  products.


  I designed and animated the finalists' proposals, which were presented for
  voting during the competition. These included illustrations, diagrams, and
  animations of how each entry worked.
