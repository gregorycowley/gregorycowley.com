  Quicktime was an Apple product released in the mid-1990s for playing video on
  a Macintosh. It was a video component player that was included with the
  operating system but could also be downloaded separately.


  Once installed, the demo animation I created would play to confirm the
  software was correctly installed. In addition, I also designed and animated
  the Quicktime TV logo for Apple's Quicktime TV offering. This was a very early
  version of what would become the AppleTV.
