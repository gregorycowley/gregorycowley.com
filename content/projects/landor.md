  For over ten years, I worked with teams at Landor Associates to brand and
  create corporate identities for companies including the Olympics, American
  Airlines, Clorox, HP, Rice a Roni, Ford Motor Company, and John Deere. As the
  leading brand identity and corporate identity company, it was a privilege to
  be a team player in both their San Francisco and Hong Kong offices.
