  Opes Advisors, a financial investment advising firm, needed an intranet for
  their employees to be able to manage their clients and internal documents. In
  addition, they required a public-facing site for marketing and blogging
  purposes. For this project, both the internet and extranet versions were built
  on Joomla.
