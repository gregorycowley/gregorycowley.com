  For the Briggo automated coffee cart, I worked from layouts supplied by a
  designer to create interactive animations that would guide customers through
  the ordering process. This kiosk used interactive touchscreens for both input
  and feedback to the client regarding the status of their order. Coffee was
  prepared by a robot, and customers were notified when their order was ready
  through feedback from an order queue screen.
