  As a designer and technical producer of the Three-Minute Picture Show, an
  annual festival of short films, I executed the branding, website, marketing
  materials, and collateral. I also managed technical coordination of the film
  screenings, including the conversion of the various formats that were
  submitted into a consistent playable format for the theater. All the events
  took place in art house theaters in San Francisco and Portland.

An Un-Curated Film Festival
Let's remind people that creativity is fun and easy.
An uncurated film festival with a mission of encouraging participants to dedicate 30 days to the creative process of making a 3 minute film. &nbsp;It lowered the barrier of entry to creative work and culminated with a faux red-carpet screening where participants and guests could see the films on the big-screen in front of a live audience.Presented at the ATA, Root Division and the Victoria Theater in San Francisco, and the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, OR.
