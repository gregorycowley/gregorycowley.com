  I created the motion graphics for a series of short films showcasing
  hypothetical digital devices seamlessly interfacing into everyday life.
title: Intel Lifestyle Interfaces
type: Content Creation
description: >
  Intel's Mobile Platform Group (MPG) has a mission to propose mobile devices
  that use Intel technology. They worked closely with IDEO to build prototypes
  that implemented Intel technologies and could be licensed by equipment
  manufacturers. Cinema quality videos with dramatic storylines were created to
  weave narratives around how the technologies would be used in the real world.


  A professional film production company was hired to produce these vignettes,
  which showed the hypothetical products being used in real-life situations.
  Within the videos, the actors would use props and green screens. My job was to
  animate graphics and overlay them in-post using After Effects. These
  non-functional prototypes were brought to life and responded to the
  interactions of the actors.
