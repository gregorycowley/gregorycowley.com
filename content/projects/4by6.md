  While working for 4by6.com, I architected an automated production system
  driven by a printing portal website. This system allowed users to upload their
  graphics files to be pre-flighted and validated for printing. Problem files
  were sorted out, and the clients were notified.


  Files that were ready for printing were organized into a grid system. The
  resulting grid could be printed on a single sheet of paper, lowering costs and
  make the more efficient use of resources. The system was fully automated,
  using web technologies as well as dedicated machines on-site and custom
  software.
