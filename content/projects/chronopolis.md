  Developed in response to the 911 atrocities, Chronopolis was a large-scale
  interactive projection installation that was presented in Paris at the La
  Villette Numerique festival.


  Chronolopis was a conceptual city represented by a graphic clock. This
  fictional place existed in between standard and metric time. Responding to the
  gathering of people on the floor, a computer measured the population to
  interpret the effect that the population has on the perception of time.

Large Scale Interctive Installation in Paris
"Chronopolis focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. By intertwining notions of time, urbanism and electronic media, we are asking how representations of time can still makes sense in a globalized, accelerated and unstable present."- Erik Adigard and Chris Salter
Chronopolis is a clock based on metric time (a French concept from the 1800's). The clock is driven by population.&nbsp;I worked with Erik and Chris as a pure collaboration with great minds. Built in San Francisco and installed in a massive new media even in Paris. I built a flash based animated grid that kept metric time. It interfaced with MAX/MSP with respond to data collected by a video camera attached to the ceiling.Installed at the La Villette numerique.
    Configuring the video projector and IR camera while on the ground.
    People wanted video game experiences. Instant gratification and responsive feedback. This wan't that kind of exhibit, which confused some people. Children in particular tried to kick, stomp on and run over the visual components to get a reaction.

Chronopolis was presented to the public as part of the Villette Numerique Digital Art Festival at the Parc de la Villette in Paris in 2002.

It was a very large scale, 10 meter square, floor projection that invited visitors to roam around its surface. The piece counted the number of people present and altered the projection based on the "local population"

The concept, by Erik Adigard and Chris Salter, focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. Put simply the artwork asked whether population distorts the perception of time. 

I contributed by creating the graphics and animations that could be dynamically morphed using data from an infrared camera placed above. The camera was attached to a computer running Max/MSP with Jitter. A second computer running an ActionScript/Flash application controlled the graphics and connected to the projector. Yes, these were early days and a single computer didn't have the processing power.
