Developed in response to the 911 atrocities, Chronopolis was a large-scale interactive projection installation that was presented in Paris at the La Villette Numerique festival.

Chronolopis was a conceptual city represented by a graphic clock. This fictional place existed in between standard and metric time. Responding to the gathering of people on the floor, a computer measured the population to interpret the effect that the population has on the perception of time.
