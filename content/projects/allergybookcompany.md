# Custom Allergy Book



## Camille's story:

Personalized Message

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I am \_\_\_\_\_\_ years old. 

I am allergic to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ tree nuts/peanuts/all nuts except. X. This means that the nuts I am allergic to are harmful to my body and can make me become very sick.  And it also means that  I need to eat the nuts I am not allergic to regularly so that I do not become allergic to them in the future.

There are things I can do to help keep myself safe. At home, we do not keep unsafe nuts in our house and my mom and dad always check the ingredients of all the food we bring into the house to make sure they are safe for me. 

When we eat away from home, things start to get a little bit tricky, but I am learning to ask questions to help keep myself healthy. In restaurants, we always tell the staff about my allergies and ask what foods are safe for me to eat. When we go to a friend’s house, we always let them know about my allergies before we go so that everyone is aware. 

At parties when there are things like birthday cakes, crackers and cookies, I always ask my parents or a trusted adult before I eat something. If the adult is not sure if a food is safe, I must not eat it. I can always bring my own special snacks and dessert with me. If someone asks me why, I can tell him or her “I have food allergies, so sometimes I bring my own food to make sure I do not have an allergic reaction.” I can still have fun with my friends and play games. Sometimes we eat different foods, and that’s OK.

At school, my friends might think it’s fun to share their food with each other, but it is very important that I eat only my own food and do not share with friends. Even if a friend tells me “It’s OK, this does not have nuts in It..” I say “No thank you.” 

If there are special treats at school, I always have to ask my teacher first: “Does this have nuts in it?” If my teacher is not sure, I do not eat the special treats. Sometimes I feel left out when this happens, but it is more important that I stay safe. I can always tell my parents how I feel and talk about it with them. 

No matter how careful I am, there is a chance that I could accidently eat a food that I am allergic to. This is why I always have epinephrine, a special allergy medicine close by. My parents always carry it with them wherever we go, and I have it at school. The medicine helps to slow the allergic reaction until I can get medical help. If I eat a food and suddenly feel strange - itchy, my stomach hurts, my throat is swelling, I am having trouble breathing or I have diarrhea - I need to immediately tell an adult. When I am older, I can carry my own epinephrine but for now an adult can help give me the medicine and call 911. 

Because I have food allergies, I need to be more careful than other kids, but I am learning to make smart choices to keep myself safe. My parents can help me practice asking questions and saying “No thank you.” to foods I am unsure of. When I feel left out , I remember that I can still play and have fun with my friends and family, even if we can’t eat the same foods.  My friends and family love me and want me to be healthy, and that is the most important thing of all!



## Greg's Story



How do I know I'm allergic?

What happens when I find out?

How can I avoid nuts? They are everywhere

What if I make a mistake?

I'm afraid to ask!

When someone says 'I don't know'

I bring my own treats

We celebrate later at home

I now have an anti-nut force field
