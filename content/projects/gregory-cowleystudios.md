Cowley Studios

### Theme:  

* Create toys that encourage sharing and fun  
\* 

I believe that entrepreneurs create and nurture much need communities.

I believe that communities are living organism that wilt or thrive through the businesses that unite them.

In the post RX Gallery malaise... tired of loosing money. Tired of "giving from root instead of my fruit", I stepped away from the art world to create a functional business. Once this was running I would return to the arts with the company as a source of funding.

The studio was a real white-box photo studio in the American Industrial Center. From there I would introduce commercial studio photography as a service as was as have a staging location for my own works.

The JuicyStock Catalog - 

I scoured Craigslist and the local theater organization sites for models. I did over 100 shoots lasting on average 4 hours.

My timing couldn't have been worse. Digital photography broke the 16k barrier. Quality digital camera's were getting cheaper each day. They digital compensated for what once required skill. 

The iPhone was the final nail in the coffin. "Good enough" photography was available to everyone. And the barrier of entry for new photographers was lower than any other point in history. The photographer became anonymous and irrelevant.

Rock stars and young guns.
