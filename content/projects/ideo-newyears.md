  IDEO began introducing an annual digital New Year's card that allowed its
  employees around the world to contribute memories of the year through an
  interactive format. For the inaugural design, each employee could make their
  own personal snowflake, which included a favorite memory and information about
  the employee. The snowflakes floated in a 3D interactive environment allowing
  team members to learn about each creator and their memory for that year.
