Open Source CNC Variation

Build Ikea in the garage and save the trip to the store.

Getting work out of the computer
Low cost and faster. Less mastery of woodworking.
Math can be useful after all.

Creating on the cheap. Building more with less.
Being able to design in the computer and output the results. Less mess. Less time. Less cost.

I believe the industrial revolution can be miniaturized and personalized.
I believe that things are not meant to be desired and bought, but can be made by the individual.

Implementation: a barrier to bringing ideas into reality

I'm a computer guy who loves to build real useful products with my hands. Getting from the computer to a tangible physical process is an expensive proposition.

On Kickstarter I came across a group in Portland that put together a CNC machine for $350. The event was over, but the community around the Maslow CNC was just beginning.

I built the CNC from what the group open sourced on Github. 

The software is Python and Arduino

I've made my own modifications to the design

The goal is accuracy. Time and money are the problem.

While not an exhibit able item in itself, it is a tool to make other projects happen.

It was time to learn math deeply. What was that stuff I learned for in the real world

## CNC Machine  

### Notes:
* Dreaming up ideas and building them in 3-D software is fun. Realizing these ideas is time consuming expensive
	* This Ikea printer
	* Printing out needed furniture and other products
	* Building in the computer first
	* Saving money, doing this on the cheap in a practical affordable way
* What is the practical application of math. What did I learn high school? How can the computer be combined with math to create physical objects?
	* Applying geometry, trigonometry and physics
	* Digging up what I learned long ago. Learning it more deeply
	* Fun with math.
	* Math as creative expression.
	* Drawbot. Drop box fascinate me. It's see ability to see the the artist hand moving virtually.
* Digital control of analogue devices
* Open source
	* Improving on the original design
	* Seeking accuracy
	* Learning how it's done. There's a human huge amount of wondering how the heck this stuff was done. Why not just left the ground up and figure it out.

CNC Machine
A low-cost open source CNC project

How can my computer really create something practical? What if it could print IKEA-ish furniture?

Cheap and open source computer production.Relatively compact for a 4x8 CNC, unfortunately accuracy is sacrificed.Use Fusion 360 to design and create gcode. Python is the interface that sends commands to an arduino controller.
