description: Find cool stuff and show it to people. I was like the idea of thinking of the letters "Rx" as an abbreviation for I "receiver", as in Rx/Tx, receiver and transmitter configuration. Our jobs as curators of the gallery Word to look out of the world and see what weird amazing unusual things not being represented and finding a way to fit them in the gallery. I'm Sure this is every Gallery school goal that everybody has their own agenda.
