- A gallery exhibit that invited participant artists from all over the world to send in camera photos that would appear in the gallery in real time.
- Camera phones had just become available, this was pre- iPhone and any social media that connected photography from phones.
- The concept was to create a meta-snapshot of the planet; to collect as many photos as possible from around the world at a single moment in time.
- The show had 400 participants from as far away as Siberia, Argentina, and Finland.
- We invented Instagram!
- Well, we created a camera phone based community before it was a thing, but we didn't have an infrastructure and the time wasn't right.
- We turned the gallery experience inside out. The audience became artists and the gallery functioned as a hub for a global effort.
- It was 2002 and suddenly we had camera's on our phones. WTF? Digital camera's had been around for a few years but the phone made the camera "connected".
- Photo's were low quality and there were little or no options for doing anything with them. Attaching the photo to an email was about it.
- It was Instagram before there was any means of sharing photos from a phone other than email. But the infrustructure was not there yet to support the idea.


### Connect the dots between a global community of camera phones  

I believe that cell phones create real human relationships where there once were none.

I believe that we could capture a meta-photograph of the entire world at a single moment in time.
I believe that this meta-snapshot would show the vast range of our diversity on this planet and also our similarities.

It was 2002 and suddenly we had camera's on our phones. WTF?

Digital camera's had been around for a few years.

Photo's were low quality and there were little or no options for doing anything with them. Attaching the photo to an email was about it.

As a photographer I saw potential. So did Kurt Bigenho who had been working with social interactions as performances.

This was the pre social media world. Flickr was just taking off. But even it didn't have a platform for the cell phone. Users uploaded photos taken with regular Digital cameras.

We turned the gallery experience inside out. The audience became artists and the gallery functioned as a hub for a global effort.

We invented Instagram!

Well, we created a camera phone based community before it was a thing, but we didn't have an infrastructure and the time wasn't right.

With the aid of Joe Jasin, a Silicon Valley magnate, we were introduced to key people at Motorola, Nokia, Intel, and other Silicon Valley muscle.

We caught the attention of the press and had numerous articles written in major publications.

Sadly, the idea floundered because we could monetize an art project. We didn't want to sell the idea to a corporation and turn the art experience into a commercial entity. We wouldn't sell out as they say.

# Three Minute Picture Show

### Remind people that creativity is fun and easy and that the barrier of entry into the arts can be as low as possible.

Make an original movie in 30 days and see it on the big screen in a real theater. Anyone, yes ANYONE, can do it. No curation involved.

The original idea of Chris Baty, creator of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), was realize by Camille Verboort.

My official title was AV club president. But in reality the job entailed much more nuanced tasks.

I handled design and production for marketing and operations. I collected the entries, formatted them for presentation. Added title slides and break timers.

A concept the connects nicely to kids education
* Introductions to the arts
* Encouraging sponteneity
* Making it fun
* Deliberately lowering the bar
	* Taking the enjoyment up a notch
* An Un-curated curated event
* Truely "social" media
* Reaching out to kids
* Reaching out
	* Film making groups
	* Bavac
	* Schools
	* Kids and adults

Facilitated setup at the venues. Venues included the Victoria Theater, the Exploratorium, the Make out room and others in San Francisco. In Portland it was the Clinton Street Theater.

The event included a children's program. We invited a kids rock band to come play. I worked on an eduction program to teach kids to make their own videos.

That was the plan at least. The videos didn't get done.

Expose people to the simplicity of telling stories using what was expensive prospects in the past.

Instigate a wave of reluctant  filmmakers.

Have fun in the process. Use fun as lubricant for getting things done.

A break away for social media and You Tube. It was real time reality immersize experience. This can be shortened to just reality

The big screen. A much more visceral form of the for-screen digital experience. The theater is an event. A one time, either you were there or you missed it, traditional performance experience.

We're getting exhausted by the small screen. Personal computers are de-volving into the tools that they were meant to be. They are terminals for tapping into the main frame that is social media, work, shopping, and entertainment. 

By themselves they don't offer an experience. Perhaps this is why the younger generations crave experience so much.

The physical real time advantages of computers become a little more clear with SnapChat apps and mobile phones. A joyful experience is possible with a group together in physical space and a toy cell phone.
