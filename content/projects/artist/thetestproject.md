Following the lead of Edward Muybridge and the persistence of vision that led to the creation of movies, this was a mechanical animation machine like the zoetrope but controlled with digital technology.

# The TEST:Project

## Express the sensation of travel. Ultimately the test project was meant to simulate the experience of travel. They combined major loves of my life wishing couldn't travel, photography, electronic media,  

I believe that the square frame of a photo, painting, movie screens limits the potential of sharing ideas.

I believe that the experience of art is more important than the art itself. The finished work is a shell, a carcass, a shadow of an experience. 

Memory and  persistence of vision. The inability for any 

A multi screened kinetic experience.

Many forms over a 5 year period

A framework for exploring ideas

Working with the limitations of the day. Video and video production where desirable but way out of reach in terms of cost and quality

Building what I wanted to see

Looking for an alternate to the framed gallery photo experience

An mechanical animation machine like the zoetrope or the flip viewer at the Musee Mechanique

Following the lead of Edward Muybridge and the persistence of vision that led to the creation of movies

My own form of fractured cinema that let me control at the frame level

Making use of 35mm camera technology

Started with relay's and later reverse engineering the analog audio sequences that controlled digital computer tech from the 70s and 80s.
