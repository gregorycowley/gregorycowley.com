> "Chronopolis focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. By intertwining notions of time, urbanism and electronic media, we are asking how representations of time can still makes sense in a globalized, accelerated and unstable present."

Chronopolis is a clock based on metric time (a French concept from the 1800's). The clock is driven by population. 

I worked with Erik and Chris as a pure collaboration with great minds. Built in San Francisco and installed in a massive new media even in Paris. I built a flash based animated grid that kept metric time. It interfaced with MAX/MSP with respond to data collected by a video camera attached to the ceiling.

Installed at the La Villette Numerique Festival in 2002.
