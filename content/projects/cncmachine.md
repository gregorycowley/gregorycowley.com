  I constructed a fully operational 4 by 8 foot CNC machine based on the Open
  Source Maslow CNC system.
description: >
  I've had a longtime interest in the fabrication of furniture and large scale
  products, but lacked the resources to produce such products. Instead, I often
  would build things by hand, limited by the tools I had. Many of the best
  designs I created were out of the range of my abilities.


  I wanted to work with computer-controlled rapid prototyping, and finally, I
  had the opportunity to build a CNC machine on my own using open source content
  from Maslow CNC. I created the initial CNC machine to work with four by eight
  sheets of plywood. Over time I've made continuous improvements to improve
  accuracy and speed. I've learned computer-controlled fabrication technology
  from the inside out.

A low-cost open source CNC project
How can my computer really create something practical? What if it could print IKEA-ish furniture?
Cheap and open source computer production.Relatively compact for a 4x8 CNC, unfortunately accuracy is sacrificed.Use Fusion 360 to design and create gcode. Python is the interface that sends commands to an arduino controller.
    Learning how it's done. There's a human huge amount of wondering how the heck this stuff was done. Why not just left the ground up and figure it out.
    Dreaming up ideas and building them in 3-D software is fun. Realizing these ideas is time consuming expensiveThis Ikea printer printing out needed furniture and other products  * Building in the computer first  * Saving money, doing this on the cheap in a practical affordable way* What is the practical application of math. What did I learn high school? How can the computer be combined with math to create physical objects?  * Applying geometry, trigonometry and physics * Digging up what I learned long ago. Learning it more deeply * Fun with math.  * Math as creative expression.  * Drawbot. Drop box fascinate me. It's see ability to see the the artist hand moving virtually.
