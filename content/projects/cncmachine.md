subtitle: >-
  I constructed a fully operational 4 by 8 foot CNC machine based on the Open
  Source Maslow CNC system.
description: >
  I've had a longtime interest in the fabrication of furniture and large scale
  products, but lacked the resources to produce such products. Instead, I often
  would build things by hand, limited by the tools I had. Many of the best
  designs I created were out of the range of my abilities.


  I wanted to work with computer-controlled rapid prototyping, and finally, I
  had the opportunity to build a CNC machine on my own using open source content
  from Maslow CNC. I created the initial CNC machine to work with four by eight
  sheets of plywood. Over time I've made continuous improvements to improve
  accuracy and speed. I've learned computer-controlled fabrication technology
  from the inside out.
