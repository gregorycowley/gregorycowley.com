  I developed a series of iPhone apps meant for the live social environment. The
  apps fostered fun for social events in bars, restaurants, at parties, and at
  work.


  The applications included an animated wheel of fortune to choose what drink
  you were going to order, a compliment generator that on upon shaking the phone
  would give you a nice compliment, and a message correspondence app that allows
  for sending handwritten notes to friends.
