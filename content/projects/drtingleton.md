  I developed a series of iPhone apps meant for the live social environment. The
  apps fostered fun for social events in bars, restaurants, at parties, and at
  work.


  The applications included an animated wheel of fortune to choose what drink
  you were going to order, a compliment generator that on upon shaking the phone
  would give you a nice compliment, and a message correspondence app that allows
  for sending handwritten notes to friends.

Feel-good apps for real world interactions
There's an app for everything. What about fun social games to share with your friends in the real world?
A series of mobile phone game apps marketed using a snake oil salesman persona.Social games that encouraged real world sharing and interaction over virtual online communication.Three apps were made. One for making decisions that was later extended to choosing a drink at the bar or a food to get for lunch. Another was a compliment maker that functioned like a Magic 8 ball.&nbsp;
    Combining interests in technology and experiences, I joined forces with Camille Verboort to create a series of apps from ideas, prototypes, development, user testing and distribution on the Apple App Store.
