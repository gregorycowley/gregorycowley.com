title: 'MPPS: The Mobile Phone Photo Show'
subtitle: >-
  The first gallery exhibit of its kind showing the work of over 400
  participants from around the world. Coinciding with the release of camera
  phones, MPPS allowed participants to send images into the gallery in real-time
  during a defined time period. The result was a meta-snapshot of the world from
  the hands of people in each region.

  The Mobile Phone Photo Show was the first cell phone photography show. The
  emergence of the mobile phone camera also opened up a new means of
  self-expression. 


  The conceptual gallery exhibit acted as an inversion of the traditional
  gallery show. Artists We're spread out all over the world, with more than 400
  contributors and their mobile phones submitting work into the gallery where it
  would be printed out and stuck on the walls. This outward in approach created
  a meta-snapshot of the world at that point in time. The event took place in
  San Francisco, but the images were submitted from as far away as Siberia,
  South Africa, India, Argentina, Australia, and Japan.

Connecting the dots between a new global community of personal camera phones
A gallery exhibit that invited participant artists from all over the world to send in camera photos that would appear in the gallery in real time.Camera phones had just become available, this was pre- iPhone and any social media that connected photography from phones.The concept was to create a meta-snapshot of the planet; to collect as many photos as possible from around the world at a single moment in time.The show had 400 participants from as far away as Siberia, Argentina, and Finland.
    We invented Instagram!Well, we created a camera phone based community before it was a thing, but we didn't have an infrastructure and the time wasn't right.
    We turned the gallery experience inside out. The audience became artists and the gallery functioned as a hub for a global effort.
    It was 2002 and suddenly we had camera's on our phones. WTF? Digital camera's had been around for a few years but the phone made the camera "connected".Photo's were low quality and there were little or no options for doing anything with them. Attaching the photo to an email was about it.
It was Instagram before there was any means of sharing photos from a phone other than email. But the infrustructure was not there yet to support the idea.
