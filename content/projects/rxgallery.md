  RX Gallery Art and Technology Space in the SF Tenderloin.

  RX Gallery was an art bar with a focus on art and technology-centered in the
  Tenderloin area of San Francisco. At the time, it was the pinnacle of art and
  technology in the region. We worked closely with artists and arts institutions
  that shared our interest in digital and electronic expression. The gallery
  operated from 2003 to 2008.

Art and Technology Wine Bar
Find cool stuff and show it to people. I was like the idea of thinking of the letters "Rx" as an abbreviation for I "receiver",   as in Rx/Tx, receiver and transmitter configuration. Our jobs as curators of the gallery Word to look out of the world and see what weird amazing unusual things not being represented and finding a way to fit them in the gallery. I'm Sure this is every Gallery school goal that everybody has their own agenda.
