# 3FeetOffTheGround
## Creative Director

* Build a place for digital art and finance it with commercial work.

If you can't beat them, join them.

The dot com era had done a lot to end the bohemian lifestyle that was affordable in San Francisco in the early 90s

Formed a company to cash out on the trends. 

Had the abilities and the connections to be successful and build a company that could also support the arts

---- 

I believe that artists need community support to survive and I believe that it's the business' responsibility to nurture the works of artists.

I believe that idealism doesn't write checks, people do. 

Print Based Works

Screen based digital works

Animations

Interactive presentations and tools

It was dark times for artists in the DotCom era. Rent were rising, the community was struggling, jobs were transitioning. The city seemed to have gone mad with greed and ambition. For me this was saddening, but there was a silver lining. I was doing well offering motion graphics and design services and there was a way to combine the art and business dilemma. I teamed up with a few colleagues who felt the same way I did and we created a company.

3feetofftheground was named after a wager between Leland Stanford and Edweard Muybridge. They bet how many feet a horse had on the ground at a full gallop. Muybridge devised a test using a series of cameras that would be triggered by a horse running by. This was the first account of a motion picture. The truth was that a horse had four feet off the ground, but there were only three of us. So that stuck

We grew quickly with clients like HP and Apple and were able to move into a giant space that would double as a theater and arts venue. 3feetofftheground's mandate was to serve the arts and business worlds equally. Taking from the rich to finance the poor. The model worked well until it didn't. The dotcom crash wiped out most of clients. Apple and HP pulled all their design and media work internally. 3feet came to a fiery end.

3feet taught me the hard truths about how business really works. Also that the easiest ship to sink is a partnership. But I did learn to manage and direct. We produced good work.

* How can I grow my art career in the current.com climate? There was a saturation of painters, photographers, sculptors. And I was more interested and the potential of the digital arts  
* What does a business model for art look like? Especially in an age where is our we were producing part that didn't have a finished product text be sold. There was the lack of an art object.
	* Looking to the future
	* Disappointed with institutions
		* Work to slow
		* Uninterested
		* No funding
			* Only educational programs for inner city kids
	* Finger on the pulse
	* Robin Hood Model
	* Big clients
* I've been working for several years of corporate clients offering Digital services such as Flash development, Photoshop, Motion graphics. The.com was well underway it has taken it's toll on the arts committee. I set out to create somthing that would help the community.
	* Taking on the dot com dementia
	* Standing up for the artists
	* Why not rethink the design studio. Instead of being a service dad simply lives to help businesses succeed. Why not also create a more symbiotic relationship? Why not create a community in which the businesses support the artists to produce content for the businesses  ![][image-1]

	* Performance and gallery space
		* Dance
			* Hip Hop
		* Theater

	* Replace to come learn, share ideas, be exposed to something new. And ideally not pay for these benefits, at least not in a way to sky break the bank. Most institutions at this time were set up to cater to their own traditional art forms

	* Video
		* Motion Graphics
		* Interactive media
		* Trade shows
