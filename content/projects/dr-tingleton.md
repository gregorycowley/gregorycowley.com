A line of products that simply entertain. Pocket games for grownups that lighten the mood.

Taking rochambeau to the next level 

pocket catalyst for real social entertainment

I believe that apps can be experiences.
I believe that making someone smile is worth a dollar.

There's an app for everything. What about fun social games to share with your friends in the real world?

Dr. Tingleton was created as a character to peddle silly user experiences on the cell phone.

The apps were social games.

Combining interests in technology and experiences, I joined forces with Camille Verboort to create a series of apps from ideas, prototypes, development, user testing and distribution on the Apple App Store.

We didn't get rich.

A series of mobile phone game apps marketed using a snake oil salesman persona.Social games that encouraged real world sharing and interaction over virtual online communication.Three apps were made. One for making decisions that was later extended to choosing a drink at the bar or a food to get for lunch. Another was a compliment maker that functioned like a Magic 8 ball.
