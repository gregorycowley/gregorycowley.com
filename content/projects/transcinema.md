  Transcinema existed to create an audience and appreciation for a global group
  of new media artists. The emerging new digital media were an acquired taste,
  and many traditional art spaces weren't recognizing the importance of this new
  genre. Transcinema was a means to educate the public about digital
  experiences, and the contemplations these experiences can evoke. 


  The emergence of new media was inspiring creative works. Transcinema intended
  to bring together a worldwide collection of artists who were working in
  similar media. 


  In order to foster universal recognition of this work, Transcinema sought to
  bring those artists together and create an audience with understanding and
  appreciation for new media artworks.
