  Dr Pepper was a major sponsor of the Academy of Country Music Awards. They
  wanted a marketing piece in the form of a CDROM to be distributed throughout
  Walmart stores. We created content that included games, videos, and musical
  toys related to the Academy of Country Music Awards. The finished disks were
  placed in displays and included free with the purchase of Dr Pepper products.
