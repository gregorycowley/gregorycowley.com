  I have been teaching at the California College of the Arts since 2002, where I
  began as a professor teaching in the graphic design department. I am currently
  teaching in the interaction design department as an adjunct professor. I teach
  sophomore and junior-level  Core fundamental courses.


  I have taught summer programs in Oakland and Paris. I've also taught and
  mentored graduate students in self-study programs.

### Teaching Digitial Tools to Design Students

For ten years I thought graphic, industrial, and interior design students the tools they would need to create interactive experiences.

Taught digital studio tools to design students as an Adjunct Professor, with an emphasis on Flash and animated interactive experiences.Taught high school students in the pre-college program, introducing them to graphic design tools and concepts.Taught independent studies at graduate student level.

Since 2002 I've taught courses in multiple departments at the California College of the Arts in SF. My students have been graduate, undergraduate, extended learning, and high school students in the pre-college program. At this time I am an adjunct professor in the Interaction Design Department.

I am currently teaching interaction design using a very narrow topic, tangible user interfaces. Students are encouraged to use affordances, signifiers, constraints and feed to create experiences that go beyond the screen.

I teach students to conceptualize, iterate, prototype and present interaction ideas. We use techniques like "smoke and mirrors" to present concepts in action before extensive development to get buy-in from the client.

I'm preaching what I practice.

Reactable is the tool of choice this semester. It is an open source C++ codebase with a Processing interface. The software uses a camera to see barcode-like fiducials and respond to their position and rotation. I am guiding students through breaking down the problems, brainstorming solutions, and developing concepts that can be translated to Reactable platform. We use interaction design principles and UX techniques throughout the course. The students will be making their own tables, installing cameras and video projectors, and writing the code needed for the user interface using Processing.

For some reason I always seem to have classes where I'm teaching designers—who hate to code—how to code. It's a daunting but rewarding task.
