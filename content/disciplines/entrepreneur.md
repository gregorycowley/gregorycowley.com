  As an entrepreneur, I've created six companies. The first was a motion
  graphics and design house. The second was an art and technology venue and wine
  bar. The third was a professional photography studio that worked with
  commercial clients and private commissions.

  I've created a stock photography website that allowed for additional
  photographers to contribute and profit from their works.

  I created a series of mobile apps for live in-person social interactions.

  I'm currently working on new business endeavors that involve the design and
  manufacturing of physical products for the home.
