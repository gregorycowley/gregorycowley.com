  Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) is the parent organization of the
  de Young Museum and The Palace Legion of Honor museum. Wolf-Olins was the
  design firm that handled the rebranding of the institution. Wolf-Olins and I
  produced the style guide for the rebranding that existed digitally as a Flash

  application.
