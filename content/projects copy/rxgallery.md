  RX Gallery Art and Technology Space in the SF Tenderloin.

  RX Gallery was an art bar with a focus on art and technology-centered in the
  Tenderloin area of San Francisco. At the time, it was the pinnacle of art and
  technology in the region. We worked closely with artists and arts institutions
  that shared our interest in digital and electronic expression. The gallery
  operated from 2003 to 2008.
