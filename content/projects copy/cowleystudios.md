  In 2005, while continuing to work on Content Management Systems, I branched
  out to explore my lifelong interest in photography.


  I built a commercial photography studio located in the Dogpatch area of San
  Francisco. There I worked with clients including IDEO, Adobe, University
  Games, and Intel. I also had hundreds of individuals come through the studio
  doors for portraiture and custom commissions.


  Although the studio itself is now closed, I cultivated relationships with
  editorial clients whom I continue to work with and am able to take on new
  clients. The physical activity and artistry involved with my photography
  business provides a nice balance to my work in web development.
