  Middleground, an Exploratorium external site project, was a series of towers
  that encouraged people to interact with activities and each other.
  Middleground itself is a rehabilitation and recovery program. The installation
  acted as a happy place to further encourage this recovery and introduce people
  to the work Middleground does. The structure was installed in Civic Center,
  near City Hall in front of the San Francisco Public Library.
