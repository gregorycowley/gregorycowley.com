  As an engineer for Blurb, I was solely responsible for Bookify, a legacy
  product application built using Adobe Flex technology. The original
  application had not been updated in years. Finding more efficient ways to
  improve the user experience was part of the job. I pruned unused code and
  improved performance by 300%. My job also included adding new features and
  maintaining the API connections with Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, and other
  photo-sharing websites. Users could also upload photos directly to the
  application in their web browser. I built a system for tracking errors,
  measuring performance, and managing customer support issues.
