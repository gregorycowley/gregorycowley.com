  Wanted Santa was a creation for ESET, a European online security company.


  Wanted Santa allowed you to get arrested, have your mugshot taken, write a
  message, and then share it freely with your friends. It was a fun Flash-based
  microsite that incorporated features such as the ability to upload your photo
  to customize the message written on the picture and then forward it as a
  single JPEG image to multiple friends.


  Because ESET was a reasonably large company, we built the system to handle a
  massive load of users using load-balancing technology.
