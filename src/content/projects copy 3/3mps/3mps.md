  As a designer and technical producer of the Three-Minute Picture Show, an
  annual festival of short films, I executed the branding, website, marketing
  materials, and collateral. I also managed technical coordination of the film
  screenings, including the conversion of the various formats that were
  submitted into a consistent playable format for the theater. All the events
  took place in art house theaters in San Francisco and Portland.
