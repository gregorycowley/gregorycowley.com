    Website design and development for O'Reilly Media's educational
    customization service.
  description: >-
    O'Reilly Media's SafariU allowed teachers to create curriculums and generate
    content for their courses from O'Reilly's vast library of books and media.
    Students could purchase, download, and print course material. I created the
    website as well as an explainer video about how the course building process
    worked.
