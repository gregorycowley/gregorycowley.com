  description: >-
    Developed in response to the 911 atrocities, Chronopolis was a large-scale
    interactive projection installation that was presented in Paris at the La
    Villette Numerique festival.  Chronolopis was a conceptual city represented
    by a graphic clock. This fictional place existed in between standard and
    metric time. Responding to the gathering of people on the floor, a computer
    measured the population to interpret the effect that the population has on
    the perception of time.
