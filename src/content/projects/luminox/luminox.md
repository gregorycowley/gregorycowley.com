  description: >-
    Luminox makes military-grade watches marketed towards the military and
    outdoor enthusiasts. I worked closely with the company founders to create an
    online catalog of their products. The site included a custom content
    management system that I hand-coded using PHP. The admin section of the site
    allowed the marketing team to add new products and update information.
