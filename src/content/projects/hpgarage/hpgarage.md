  titleMain: HP Garage Innovation System
  subtitle: >-
    This project was team collaboration and brainstorming in the true IDEO
    style. I joined a team of bright minds for multiple weeks of discussion and
    deep thought to develop an innovation and training system for HP employees.

    HP Garage was the name given to planned innovation spaces that would be
    developed on HPs campuses. The innovation space would include activities,
    directives, motivation tools for employees to work together for both team
    building and improvement of their products using IDEO's human-centered
    design approach.
