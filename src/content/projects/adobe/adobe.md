  description: >-
    Acting as producer and lead photographer, I created images for the packaging
    of Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements.  I worked closely
    with the client to coordinate the initial casting sessions, prop
    procurement, and managed cast and crew to get the job done on schedule and
    within budget.
