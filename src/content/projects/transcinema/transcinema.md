  description: >-
    Transcinema existed to create an audience and appreciation for a global
    group of new media artists. The emerging new digital media were an acquired
    taste, and many traditional art spaces weren't recognizing the importance of
    this new genre. Transcinema was a means to educate the public about digital
    experiences, and the contemplations these experiences can evoke.  The
    emergence of new media was inspiring creative works. Transcinema intended to
    bring together a worldwide collection of artists who were working in similar
    media.  In order to foster universal recognition of this work, Transcinema
    sought to bring those artists together and create an audience with
    understanding and appreciation for new media artworks.
