  titleMain: Briggo Automated Coffee Cart
  subtitle: Multi-screen kiosk User Interface Development.
  description: >-
    For the Briggo automated coffee cart, I worked from layouts supplied by a
    designer to create interactive animations that would guide customers through
    the ordering process. This kiosk used interactive touchscreens for both
    input and feedback to the client regarding the status of their order. Coffee
    was prepared by a robot, and customers were notified when their order was
    ready through feedback from an order queue screen.
