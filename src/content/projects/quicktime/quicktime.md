    Website design and development for O'Reilly Media's educational customization
    service.

    O'Reilly Media's SafariU allowed teachers to create curriculums and generate
    content for their courses from O'Reilly's vast library of books and media.
    Students could purchase, download, and print course material. I created the
    website as well as an explainer video about how the course building process
    worked.

  Quicktime was an Apple product released in the mid-1990s for playing video on
  a Macintosh. It was a video component player that was included with the
  operating system but could also be downloaded separately.


  Once installed, the demo animation I created would play to confirm the
  software was correctly installed. In addition, I also designed and animated
  the Quicktime TV logo for Apple's Quicktime TV offering. This was a very early
  version of what would become the AppleTV.
