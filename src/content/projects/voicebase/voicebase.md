    Worked as a software engineer with a team to create two products for a voice
    recognition startup.
  description: >-
    As a software engineer at VoiceBase, a startup that works with voice
    recognition and AI analytics for call centers, I was responsible for
    creating a visual transcription player. This audio player would play through
    an audio recording and highlight the words in a written AI-generated
    transcript. The player was the only front-end for what was almost entirely
    an API voice recognition and voice analytics service.  I worked with the
    team to create a developer portal to add to the company offering that would
    give further visual control to developers for the API. The motivation was
    also to allow upper management, which is not familiar with an API system's
    inner workings, to visualize and understand VoiceBase's product and to
    create visualization tools for a non-technical audience.
