  subtitle: Development of various websites for Napa based wineries.
  description: >-
    I built a number of websites for the niche market that is Napa wineries.
    Napa is a very close community, and several companies focus almost entirely
    on producing websites for the wineries.  For these projects, I translated
    Photoshop designs supplied by these firms into HTML, CSS, and Flash.
