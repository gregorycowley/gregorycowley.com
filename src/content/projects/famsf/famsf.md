    Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) is the parent organization of the
    de Young Museum and The Palace Legion of Honor museum. Wolf-Olins was the
    design firm that handled the rebranding of the institution. Wolf-Olins and I
    produced the style guide for the rebranding that existed digitally as a
    Flash application. The style-guide was easily distributed as cross-platform
    application.
