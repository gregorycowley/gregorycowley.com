  subtitle: >-
    A conceptual and experiential new media arts project using projection for
    live performances and installations.
  description: >-
    I created live, computer-controlled sight, sound, and spatial experiences.
    These involved immersive multi-screen projections that surrounded the
    audience.  The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides. I used slide
    projectors instead of video projectors to create a mechanical zoetrope that
    would play short sequences of animation with quarter-second intervals. The
    animations were shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. Slides
    were loaded into the slide projector in the same order and played in looping
    fashion. It was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate
    the projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a digital control panel. I would
    use up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also
    be a component.  The purpose of the test project was to explore how memories
    are recalled in a fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember
    things as a continuous stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments
    filled with feeling. Moments filled with fluttering details.  I was also
    exploring the possibility of implanted memories. By using iconic, generic,
    and agnostic imagery that would relate to broad experiences, I aimed to
    trigger memories in the viewer.
