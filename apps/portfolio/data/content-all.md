Gregory Cowley is a lifestyle and editorial portrait photographer based in San Francisco. He began his career in 1992 working in the Bay Area design, branding and advertising industry after graduating with a BFA in graphic design. In these early days Gregory explored photography as a fine art and shot liberally in the hours after his day job was complete. Photography was always his primary love, but he kept this creative outlet open to the arts and not to commerce.

In 1994 Gregory relocated to Hong Kong where he continued to work in the design industry. It was there that he began a series of journeys into the remote regions of China and South East Asia. He created a series of photo essays about the people and cultures in these regions. This was the beginning of Gregory's passion for portraiture. He remains an avid traveller and his photography adventures have taken him to five continents.

After returning to San Francisco, Gregory focused his photography work on the fine arts and gallery circuit. He was inspired by the work of Bill Viola and Gary Hill. In 1997 he launched an ambitious project to explore the performance possibilities of photography. The aptly named TEST project was started in 1997 and used up to 32 slide projectors over 8 screens to create immersive visual environments. Gregory’s work appeared as installations at The Here Art Center in New York, Portland State University, The Exploratorium, and SFMOMA.

In 2005 Gregory embraced photography as his full time passion. Since then he’s been producing high-end photography for top commercial photography clients. Gregory has honed his skills as a studio photographer and master of lighting. He has worked with celebrities and keeps his attention on the need for good story telling and connection with his subjects. He works diligently to unite the values of photojournalism, fine art photography, and graphic design. Gregory remains a craftsman and believes strongly in skill and attention to detail.

In addition to his work as a photographer Gregory has also spearheaded interactivity and technology projects in the arts world through the creation of the Transcinema Festival and the Rx Gallery. Currently he is an adjunct professor at the California College of the Arts. He has taught courses at the Academy of Art University and regularly teaches workshops out of his studio in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco.

--- About Gregory Cowley

I'm a seasoned creative and technical professional working out of San Francisco, CA.

I have held many different roles throughout my career, but all with a common theme: creating visual experiences, tools and interfaces for clients.

Gregory Cowley, b. 1970

ARTIST/DESIGNER/ENGINEER



With over 25 years of professional interactive design and development experience, I offer a strong understanding of and intuitive sense for user interface design. I combine problem-solving with creativity and communication, and I have a keen sense of attention to detail. I have studied the business from many different angles and learned about the many different sides of an industry that connects customers with products.

In the past, I have worked with Adobe, Apple, Intel, IDEO, Pepsi and Dr. Pepper. I have photographed executives at Facebook, Visa, Schwab, and Yahoo. Additionally, my work has been featured everywhere from Wired Magazine to The Scientist, Discover Magazine, and USAToday.

Put simply, I'm an enterprise-level software engineer with a broad range of practical skills that cover all aspects of design and development and with an extensive knowledge of leading computer-based technologies. But I'm also...

A photographer who specializes in editorial, corporate and commercial clients.

A graphic designer who has worked on projects for worldwide brands.

An adjunct professor who teaches design and development at the graduate level.

An electronic media artist whose work has been shown internationally.

My superpower is that I combine a broad range of knowledge with an intense work ethic. I started out as a print designer and moved through various interactive technologies to become the developer that I am today. With a healthy dose of craft and a whole lot of experience, I can safely say that I will get any job done right.&nbsp;

Let's build incredible things together. Let's tell stories and create experiences. Let's see what what we're capable of. Call me, email me, message me. I'm eager to talk with you.&nbsp;

# Blurb Bookify

*Online Book Design Web Application*

As an engineer for Blurb, I was solely responsible for Bookify, a legacy product application built using flex technology, which had not been updated in years.

And eight years. It relied heavily on Adobe Flash, which was being phased out the time. My job was to improve the product, add new features, maintain the API connections with Facebook, Instagram, flicker, and other photo-sharing websites. Allowing users to upload photos themselves directly to the application in their web browser.

Tracking errors, measuring performance, dealing with customer support issues, and finding more efficient ways to improve the user experience.

This is one example of the type of work I've been doing since 2010. My title has been Senior Software Engineer and I've been working on applications built for the web and mobile devices.

Blurb Bookify was an enterprise level online book editor that allowed customers to choose templates, upload photos, arrange and design pages, add text, preview, and ultimately publish a color coffee table book.

Bookify was my primary focus while working for Blurb. I was the lead engineer and soley responsible for the engineering of the project. However, at times I was allowed to bring on other team members that I oversaw.

We used the Agile Methodology. New features and bug fixes were added in two-week sprints. I worked with the QA, a project manager, and a product owner during daily scrum meetings to plan sprints and target quarterly objectives.

 Bookify was built in ActionScript 3.0, the much-maligned code behind Flash. In reality it was was Java that sort of resembled JavaScript. The backend was driven by Ruby. The workflow included Git, Jenkins, Groovy, Selenium, Jira, and Ant for building.

I later led the effort to rebuild the application using JavaScript and React, once it was clear that Flash was about to expire.

---

 Since 2002 I've taught courses in multiple departments at the California College of the Arts in SF. My students have been graduate, undergraduate, extended learning, and high school students in the pre-college program. At this time I am an adjunct professor in the Interaction Design Department.

I am currently teaching interaction design using a very narrow topic, tangible user interfaces. Students are encouraged to use affordances, signifiers, constraints and feed to create experiences that go beyond the screen.

I teach students to conceptualize, iterate, prototype and present interaction ideas. We use techniques like "smoke and mirrors" to present concepts in action before extensive development to get buy-in from the client.

I'm preaching what I practice.

Reactable is the tool of choice this semester. It is an open source C++ codebase with a Processing interface. The software uses a camera to see barcode-like fiducials and respond to their position and rotation. I am guiding students through breaking down the problems, brainstorming solutions, and developing concepts that can be translated to Reactable platform. We use interaction design principles and UX techniques throughout the course. The students will be making their own tables, installing cameras and video projectors, and writing the code needed for the user interface using Processing.

For some reason I always seem to have classes where I'm teaching designers—who hate to code—how to code. It's a daunting but rewarding task.

# Chronopolis

*Large Scale Interctive Installation in Paris*

Chronopolis was a large scale interactive installation that was presented in Paris at La Villette Numerique festival. A significant new media festival and in Europe

This was a large scale graphic clock that responded to the gathering of people on the floor and was meant to show or was meant to interpret the effect that population has on time perception.

The Chronololis concept was developed in response to the 911 atrocities.

Large Scale Interctive Installation in Paris "Chronopolis focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. By intertwining notions of time, urbanism and electronic media, we are asking how representations of time can still makes sense in a globalized, accelerated and unstable present."- Erik Adigard and Chris Salter Chronopolis is a clock based on metric time (a French concept from the 1800's). The clock is driven by population.&nbsp;I worked with Erik and Chris as a pure collaboration with great minds. Built in San Francisco and installed in a massive new media even in Paris. I built a flash based animated grid that kept metric time. It interfaced with MAX/MSP with respond to data collected by a video camera attached to the ceiling.Installed at the La Villette numerique.



 Configuring the video projector and IR camera while on the ground.



 People wanted video game experiences. Instant gratification and responsive feedback. This wan't that kind of exhibit, which confused some people. Children in particular tried to kick, stomp on and run over the visual components to get a reaction.

---

 Chronopolis was presented to the public as part of the Villette Numerique Digital Art Festival at the Parc de la Villette in Paris in 2002.

It was a very large scale, 10 meter square, floor projection that invited visitors to roam around its surface. The piece counted the number of people present and altered the projection based on the "local population"

The concept, by Erik Adigard and Chris Salter, focuses on our collective interdependency with the mechanisms and meanings of time. Put simply the artwork asked whether population distorts the perception of time.

 I contributed by creating the graphics and animations that could be dynamically morphed using data from an infrared camera placed above. The camera was attached to a computer running Max/MSP with Jitter. A second computer running an ActionScript/Flash application controlled the graphics and connected to the projector. Yes, these were early days and a single computer didn't have the processing power.

# Cowley Studios

*Professional White Box Photography Studio in Dogpatch, SF*

In 2005, I branched away from design development, at least partially, to explore my lifelong interest in photography.

















I created a photography studio so that I could work commercially with clients. A white box studio with giant windows became Gregory Cowley Studios. I located in the Dogpatch area of San Francisco. Through my studio, I worked with clients like IDEO, Adobe, University Games, and Intel.









And I had thousands of individuals come through the studio doors for portraiture.

# MPPS: The Mobile Phone Photo Show

*The first gallery exhibit of its kind showing the work of over 400 participants from the around the world. Coinciding with the release of camera phones, MPPS applowed participants to send images into the gallery in realtime during a defined time period. The result was a meta-snapshot of the world in hands of ordinary people.*

The mobile phone photo show was the first of its kind. It was the dawning of the mobile phone camera. And the show acted as an inversion of the traditional gallery show. Artists We're spread out all over the world, with more than 400 contributors and their mobile phones submitting work into the gallery where it would be printed out and stuck on the walls. This outward in approach created a meta snapshot of the world at that point in time. The event took place in San Francisco, but the images were submitted from Siberia, South Africa, India, Argentina, and all over the world.

Connecting the dots between a new global community of personal camera phones A gallery exhibit that invited participant artists from all over the world to send in camera photos that would appear in the gallery in real time.Camera phones had just become available, this was pre- iPhone and any social media that connected photography from phones.The concept was to create a meta-snapshot of the planet; to collect as many photos as possible from around the world at a single moment in time.The show had 400 participants from as far away as Siberia, Argentina, and Finland.



 We invented Instagram!Well, we created a camera phone based community before it was a thing, but we didn't have an infrastructure and the time wasn't right.



 We turned the gallery experience inside out. The audience became artists and the gallery functioned as a hub for a global effort.



 It was 2002 and suddenly we had camera's on our phones. WTF? Digital camera's had been around for a few years but the phone made the camera "connected".Photo's were low quality and there were little or no options for doing anything with them. Attaching the photo to an email was about it. It was Instagram before there was any means of sharing photos from a phone other than email. But the infrustructure was not there yet to support the idea.

# The TEST:Project

*A conceptual and experiential new media arts project. Performed live and installed nationaly*

As a founder of the test project, I created a computer-controlled live sight, sound, and spatial experience, involving projections and immersive involving projections and strategically placed screens that surrounded the audience in immersing them in the experience.

 The primary driving medium was standard 2x2 slides, which I borrowed from my interest in photography. I use slide projectors instead of video projectors to create mechanical zoetrope. That would play sequences of animation in four and four quarter-second intervals.

 Animations would be shot using a 35-millimeter camera with a motor wind. These slides would then be loaded into the slide projector in the same order and played back and looping fashion. It was a computer-controlled system, which allowed me to manipulate the projectors, up to 32 at a time, through a computer control panel.

 I would use up to 10 screens for a single performance. Video projection would also be a component.

 The purpose of the test project was to explore memories and how memories exist in our minds in a fabricated or fractured fashion. Rarely do we remember things as a continuous stream of events. It's usually small moments. Moments filled with feeling. Moments filled with fluttering details.

 I was also exploring the possibility of implanted memories because I would use iconic imagery that would trigger memories and almost anybody's generic imagery agnostic imagery.

 The test pet project was a collaboration between.

An series of fractured cinema perfomances and installations AV combination performance and installation artConceptualized and executed computer control of analog devices, primarily 32 slide projectors at a time aimed at multiple screens.Presented to the public in San Francisco, San Jose, New York and Portland



 Following the lead of Edward Muybridge and the persistence of vision that led to the creation of movies, this was a mechanical animation machine like the zoetrope but controlled with digital technology.



In the early 90's, I started my new media artist career using a platform of screens, projectors, photography, electronics, sound, and software that I affectionately called TEST:. I presented the work as both a performance and installation depending on the venue and the content.

The objective was to explore how the images affect memories. Like smell which can instantly trigger thoughts of childhood experience, an image, even one you didn't take, can trigger a memory of something similar. A place, a pet, a loved one, a time or an experience.



Images become both a mirror for you to reflect your own experience and a shadow, literally, of an event in the past. Digital has taken magic out of the process, but the original transparent slide is literally a shadow, a capturing of light reflecting off a very real object. It's a signature, a thumbprint, of the people, places, and things represented in the image.

The initial control system used Macromedia Director and Lingo along with assembly language on PIC processors. Later ActionScript was used to create a UI that functioned like a drum squencer.

The overall hardware. software and content design of TEST: was iterated through trial and error. Each performance was a 'test', and the thus the name. Ideas were tried, tweaks were made, and the entire contraption was dismantled, rebuilt, and reinstalled in different venues.

Bulk was a problem and ultimately killed the project. I shipped over a ton to places as far as New York for installations. It wasn't practical.

I'd like to see TEST: reborn using custom made projection systems. The tech has evolved to where Kodak Ektagraphic projectors and even the standard 2x2 slide are irrelevant. Using video projectors would be a distraction—simply repackaging the idea for a different format. But custom designed devices making use of custom optics, LEDs, pneumatics, and encoders could really be something different.

# Intel Mobile Platform Group - Zephyros

*Directed and produced a fully interactive presentation. A prototype product created through partnership between IDEO and Intel. Fully produced in-house by Gregory Cowley Studios.*

Zephyros was a project initiated by the Intel mobile platforms group.

 It was a collaboration with IDEO who produced functional prototypes of a system.

 The prototypes were portable electronics foreshadowing the coming of the iPhone and the iPad. And what we take for granted now is mobile technology. The Zephyros project was a presentation, an interactive presentation that showed the use of hypothetical products or hypothetical prototypes. In the context of different countries around the world. The Zephyros presentation took the audience from Beijing to Seoul, Korea, to San Francisco. Some Sao Paulo and Brazil, Munich in Germany,

 Delhi in India. And I believe that's all.

 But it showed a range of users from business professionals to students to backpackers, travelers, and ordinary people. Zephyros was meant to show how these products can be integrated into everyday life. And to show how the ways that it could have to enhance work and life experiences for the users.

An educator and teacher.

 It's my job to research the best techniques to be able to present things to my students. In some cases, I'm able to benefit from having done such things on the job. But in other cases, I need to teach something that I don't necessarily use daily on my in my day job work. So I've had to learn about it. In the evenings, I've taught myself to program, taught myself calculus, I've taught myself to build and work with robotics and mechanics. I've taught myself craftsmanship. To be able to fabricate.

 And I've taught myself everything that I've needed to know about computer tools from Photoshop. In the first. And the first version of Photoshop in the late 80s, along with the first version of Illustrator.

# Years of Experience

*Been working overtime in San Francisco since 1992*

I moved to SF to begin my career as a print designer. I spent a considerable amount of time in Asia and Europe meeting new collaborators in my chosen field.

My experience in this in the field that I work in involves my entire life of 50 years. But the more formal education of it began in 1982.

 I've been doing this stuff my whole life.

 I studied insurance internationally, with spending time abroad at the University of Lancashire in the UK, which at the time was one of the foremost graphic design education institutions in the UK. I studied British design aesthetics, which were very different from the American design aesthetic primarily around the concept's idea. At this time in the 80s and early 90s, American design was very much about aesthetics and. And how something looked. While British design was very much about humor and cleverness and about what, it made you think

 I walked away with a mixed understanding graphic design was meant to be.

*Information about what I do*

Me and who I am.

 I've forever been obsessed with technology and the arts. I was traditionally trained as a painter and photographer and visual artist.

 I'd always been a different attracted to the possibilities of electronics in the arts. During my childhood, access to such things as animation tools and motion pictures and video equipment was not an option because of the cost involved, and even super eight films were out of my price range. So I was very, very interested in what could be hacked together to create these experiences without having any kind of budget whatsoever. I worked early on with garage sale to find secondhand store discoveries, explore what I could do with,

manipulate, and learn from. I'm the son of an electrical engineer or, more importantly, somebody who takes televisions and install satellite dishes or work with satellite TV technologies. So I grew up with soldering irons and in Scylla scopes and the like. Technology came to be very easy, as did the arts and visual expression.

 I was a movie buff. I loved and had a fascination with fantasy.

 I've developed my sub-skills carefully through an ongoing obsession with learning that has existed my entire life. I am forever learning about new things, sometimes by choice and sometimes not by choice.
