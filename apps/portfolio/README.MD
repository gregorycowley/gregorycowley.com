NextJS driven portfolio site

Configured for NextJS and Webpack 4.0

## Requires:

### Webpack to be manually installed within the local node_modules. 
```bash

  npm install --save-dev webpack@4.44.0 

```


# Options:

### Webpack 5 can be disabled in the nextjs.config.js
```js
  webpack5: false,

  // and/or

  future: {
    webpack5: true,
  },

```

This is not essential, maybe because webpack 4 has already been installed.
