As an interaction designer...

I've been entering the industry of immersive experiences.

Working for museums and the cultural sector.

Creating works that are meant to be live, time based, and experienced in a physical form.

My past work:

- Visual Designer: trained in core concepts of graphic design. Started with Xactos and Rubylith on the doormat of the desktop revolution.

- Hybrid Designer/Developer focused on creating Flash ricvh media experiences.

- Software Engineer working in front lines of Silicon Valley startups.

- Museum Exhibit creator tasked with prototyping and fabrication of exhibits. Many of which have been shipped to museums in Singapore, Brazil, Kuwait, and Nebraska.

- Creative Technologist for a Melborne, Austraulia based experience design company.
